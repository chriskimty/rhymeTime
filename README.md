# About
<p><a href="https://itsrhymetime.netlify.app/"> rhymeTime</a> is a single-page React application that generates rhymes per user-generated search word.</p>

<p>This project was completed in November 2022 with <a href="https://junocollege.com">Juno College's</a> Web Development Bootcamp ✨ Cohort 44 ✨, as part of a solo React project, to showcase my understanding of:</p>

- Core React concepts (state, props, components, app architecture)
- Working with third-party API/data sources
- Error handling
- UI design
- Functional programming
- Environmental variables

<p>
rhymeTime is graciously powered by the <a href="https://www.wordsapi.com/">WordsAPI</a>, and additional features are soon to be added including: </p>

- A synonym generator 
- An antonym generator
